Trip To Galaxy by Subtain Tariq Malik

A Solar System for Educational Purpose of Students

User Perspective:
	-A VR View of Solar System
	-On interactin name of planet appears on it top
	-Contains 9 Planets, Earth with it's moon, And a Sun
	-A button also appears on top of planet
	-on interaction with that button it shows you the the information/detail of that planet

Developer Perspective:
	-Contain 3 Scripts
		-Planet ( Model Class for the Planet and Create list of planet (properties and methods for planet) )
		-planetRotator ( for setting position and rotation of planet )
		-gameController ( for gameController events and many GUI functions functionalities )
	-Prefabs
		-Sun
		-Planets
		-Box (Button on Top of Planet)
		-Game Controller
	-GvrEventSystem
		-To handle the pointerEnter and pointerExit
	-Canvas
		-For Information in 2d text 
	-Planet Model Class
		-String pName, pDetails pLengthOfDay pTemperatue pNoOfMoons pMass pTimeForAxis pTimeForSun;
        	-float pRadius pAxisRotaion pOrbitRotation pDistanceFromCenter 
		- Methods -createList, getPlanetbyIndex, getPlanetbyName
	-My Measurements
		pRadius 		=> Radius(real/1000) & Diameter is 2xR 
                pAxisRotaion 		=> Axis Rotaion using mi/s => 10.892 km/h (0.018 mi/s)  //Equator Moves at that speed
                pOrbitRotation 		=> Orbital Rotation r=(km/s) r/10 
                pDistanceFromCenter	=> Distance from center (miles/10,000,000)
                pLengthOfDay		=> length of day in hrs
                pTemperatue 		=> mean temp in c
                pNoOfMoons		=> no of known moons
                pMass			=> mass * 10^24kg
                pTimeForAxis		=> time to spin own axis (days)
                pTimeForSun		=> time to orbit  (days or hrs)

Note:
  This Trip to galaxy is almost complete but i am thinking for taking it to next level and release it's android version
  on playstore (using my account). If it's beta mode developers expected results
